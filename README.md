  <p>
    Let AI generate and read bedtime stories for your kids.

</div>

## Free and Open Source

Beru is free and open source. You use it with your own API keys which stored securely.

API Keys needed:

- OpenAI API Key
- HumeAI API Key

## Notes

OpenAI doesn't have a free tier.

I think 5-10 dollars should be enough for a while.

---

HumeAI's free tier has a limit of 10 000 characters per month.

I recommend getting the first or second paid plan if you plan on using this for a while for your kids.

If you've a bunch of stories already, instead of generating new ones, you can play the old ones for your kids again to save on credits.

Of course, as long as the kid doesn't notice it's the same story as before hehe
